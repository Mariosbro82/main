# Old Try - Complete Application Archive

This folder contains the **entire previous application** including all features, pages, and functionality.

## What's Inside

This is a complete backup of the application before restructuring:

- ✅ Full source code (`src/`)
- ✅ Server code (`server/`)
- ✅ Shared utilities (`shared/`)
- ✅ Public assets (`public/`)
- ✅ Configuration files
- ✅ All pages (Dashboard, Calculator, Comparison, etc.)
- ✅ All components
- ✅ Complete routing system
- ✅ API endpoints
- ✅ Database integration

## Purpose

This folder serves as:
1. **Reference** - Look up how things were implemented
2. **Backup** - Restore if needed
3. **Archive** - Historical record of the project

## Status

⚠️ **ARCHIVED** - This code is kept for reference only. Active development happens in `/new-try`.
