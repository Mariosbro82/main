### Key Components

- `OnboardingWizard.tsx` - Main wizard component
- `onboardingStore.ts` - State management
- `steps/*` - Individual form steps

### Usage Example

```tsx
import OnboardingWizard from './components/onboarding/OnboardingWizard';
import { useOnboardingStore } from './stores/onboardingStore';

function App() {
  const isCompleted = useOnboardingStore(state => state.isCompleted);
  
  return (
    <div>
      {!isCompleted ? (
        <OnboardingWizard />
      ) : (
        <YourMainApp />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```
